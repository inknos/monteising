\section*{Introduction}
The Ising model is a well studied model in Statistical Mechanics which describes ferromagnetism phenomena. It is characterized by a microscopic configuration space based on D-dimensional lattice, that brings to macroscopic statistical quantities. Moreover it can easily generalize the concept of collective effects caused by binary valued points interacting in pairs; for this reason the Ising model became the core of the physics of complex systems. In the last decades computational methods have been applied to search a numerical solution for the 3D Ising model in order to  fill the lack of an analytical solution.
\\
Alongside Metropolis algorithm became the most popular method of important sampling in MC. The basic idea of a weighted sampling based on the importance of a region determined a great step for the numerical solutions in general. Under these premises we want to outline the purpose this work wants to pursuit: finding numerical solution of the ND-dimensional Ising model with Metropolis algorithm.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Ising model and importance sampling}
The Ising model is a physical-mathematical model characterized by a lattice of local spins in the [-1;+1] domain. The correspondent energy is proportional to the quadratic interaction of near spins ($\sigma_i$):

\begin{equation}
  H(q, \sigma) = \sum_{<l,m>}^{'} -J\sigma_i\sigma_j
\end{equation}
Where $J$ is the energy interaction term and we sum over the neighbours.
\\
The system has  a macroscopic equilibrium state (macrostate) described by statistical quantities: number of spins $N$, lattice volume $V$, energy $E$, magnetization $M$. According to the Statistical Mechanics theory we consider the thermodynamic limit, i.e. $N, V \rightarrow \infty$ and $N/V = cost$ in order to have negligible fluctuations on energy and magnetisation: $(\Delta E)^2 / \langle E \rangle = O  (1/ \sqrt{N}) $.
From a theoretical point of view we consider an ensemble of lattices, each one with a particular configuration of spins (microstate) that corresponds to the same macrostate; we underlying that all microstates are independent and equiprobable. The configuration space is described through the Hamiltonian formalism indeed, under ergodic hypothesis, the system visits all microstates. Moreover stationary hypothesis implies the existence of an equilibrium state in which  the probability distribution of the microstates satisfies the Liouville theorem. These hypotheses bring respectively to the following statements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the $t \rightarrow \infty$ limit: the average (over all the ensemble) of a physical quantity is equal to the temporal average of that quantity.
\item The probability distribution of the microstates depends only on the Hamiltonian:
  \begin{equation}
    \rho (q, \sigma ) \propto \exp \lbrace- \beta H(q, \sigma ) \rbrace
  \end{equation}
  Where $q$ is the spin position on the lattice and $\beta$ is the product of the Boltzmann constant and the temperature $T$ of the system.
\end{enumerate}


In a finite case the Ising model system is characterized by magnetization and  energy fluctuations that brings us to consider it under canonical formalism. We define the partition function as follow: $Z = \sum_q exp [  -\beta H(q) ]$. The model simulation can be done through Monte Carlo method, i.e. we generate a pseudo-random chain of numbers in order to extract a microstate sample (from all the configuration space) distributed by the following equilibrium distribution of probability:
\begin{equation}
  P_{eq}(q)=\exp \lbrace -\beta H(q)\rbrace /Z
\end{equation}
In practice we cannot compute the partition function, moreover an algorithm that search over all the phase space has not a great performance.


% -----------------------------PAG 3----------------------------------%
\newpage
The Boltzmann's factor as probability of choosing a configuration gives a great improvement for the simulation. In this way we are not sampling all the configuration space but a selected and uniform distributed microstates collection. This approach is called \textit{importance sampling} and it allows us to calculate physical quantities as the average number over the extracted configuration:
$$
  \langle E \rangle_N = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}{E(q_i)}
$$
This intuition can be proved under ergodic hypothesis: in fact we can consider an evolving Ising system in which there is a spin flip at each time step. The temporal collection of microstates is a Markov chain with a transition probability ($W$) that leads the system to the unique equilibrium probability in the $t \rightarrow \infty$ limit. Indeed the ratio of the transition probability is:
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{W(q \rightarrow q')}{W(q' \rightarrow q)} = \dfrac{P_{eq}(q')}{P_{eq}(q)}= \exp \lbrace \beta [E(q) - E(q')] \rbrace
\end{equation}
Where $q$ and $q'$ are respectively the configuration before the spin-flip and after. This implies the equivalence between importance sampling and random extraction. The arbitrary choose on $W(q \rightarrow q')$ determines the particular algorithm; for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm:
\begin{eqnarray}
W(q \rightarrow q') = min \bigg \lbrace 1 , \dfrac{P_r(q')P_{eq}(q')}{P_r(q)P_{eq}(q)} \bigg \rbrace
\end{eqnarray}
Where $P_r(q)$ is the probability to be in the $q$ configuration; we consider symmetric probability: $P_r(q)=P_r(q')$. In this way the configuration $q'$ is more probable than $q$ if $P_{eq}(q')>P_{eq}(q)$ and the step transition could occurs with the following probabilities and conditions:
\[
\begin{cases}
  W(q \rightarrow q')=1 &\quad \Delta E \leq 0 \\
  W(q \rightarrow q')=\exp \lbrace -\beta  \Delta E  \rbrace  &\quad \Delta E > 0
\end{cases}
\]
\bigskip

\subsection*{Phase transition in Ising model}
Magnetization in Ising model shows phase transition at a certain temperature called $T_c$. This means that the logarithm of the partition function has critical point of the first order in this point and two different statistical descriptions concurrently exist at $T_c$. Indeed the magnetization curve has two different fits before this point and after, that corresponds to inner configuration of spins: random that corresponds to $\langle M \rangle = 0$ and ordered with $\langle M \rangle \rightarrow +1 / -1$.

\section{Code}
This section's aim is to introduce the reader to the C++ implementation of the model. The code is based on TObject class of Root and its scheme is the following:

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{img/Schema_classi.png}
  \caption{Class scheme}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Lattice Implementation}

A D-dimensional cubic Lattice with N spins along each edge is decribed by the array :
$$\mathbf{L} = (L_0,L_1,..,L_{N^D-1})$$
Let $i$ denote the index of the array,  $ i = \{0,1,...,N^D-1\}$  \\
$L_i = \{0,1\}$ is a boolean representing respectively spin-down and spin-up by convention \\
Let $i$-$spin$ denote the spin represented by $L_i$ entry. \\

\subsection*{Coordinates Computation}
The cartesian coordinates $\mathbf{a} = (a_0,a_1,..,a_{D-1})$ of the $i$-spin can be computed from index
$i$ if a convention is set on the Lattice arrangement, which in our Model is the following:

\item[] Origin \textit{O} of the D-dimensional space is a spin-vertex of the cubic Lattice,
	    each edge starting from \textit{O} is aligned along one of the D positive directions.
\item[] Unitary distance between each couple of adjacent spins
\item[] Spins indexing starts from increasing first dimension’s coordinate, than second and so forth
\item[\textbf{n.b.}] This rules imply that, given a specific spin, each coordinate $a_j$ has values in range $\{0,1,…,N1\}$.
\end{itemize}
Index $i$ can be expressed as a power series of $N$ with coefficients equal to the coordinates of the $i-spin$ \\
$$ i = \sum_{j=1}^{D-1}a_jN^j $$
Coordinates $a_j$ are computed according to :

$$a_j = [i\%N^{j+1}]/N^j$$
\textbf{\%} symbol denotes modular division. e.g. 7\%3=1
\\
\\
Periodic boundary conditions are applied in order to reduce finite-scale effects.


\newpage
\subsection{Energy Computation}

Lattice's energy is given by equation (1). \\
The algorithm for energy computation takes array $\mathbf{L}$ and performs two for loops : \\ one loop over the system's dimension $d = (0,1,..,D-1)$ and the other loop over index $i = (0,1,..,N^D-1)$. \\
The key idea is that, given a fixed $i$-spin, along each dimension $d$ two neighbours $i_{d_\pm}$-spin are found on the increasing and decreasing d-coordinate respectively.\\
So each single spin has $2D$ interacting neighbours in total, by summing up their energy interaction terms the contribute of the single spin to the total energy is obtained. \\ So energy can be rewritten as :

$$H = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{N^D-1}\sum_{d=0}^{D-1}\sum_{\pm}^{} -J\sigma_i\sigma_{i_{d_\pm}}$$
Performing $\sum_{i}^{}$ , double countings of couples occur and a factor $1/2$ is required. \\
For each fixed index $i$ ,the algorithm takes into account only the interaction term with the
$i_{d_+}$-spin so that the number of operation is halved. So the algorithm computes :

$$H = \sum_{i=0}^{N^D-1}\sum_{d=0}^{D-1}-J(L_i \ \oplus \ L_{i_{d_+}})$$
$\sigma_i\sigma_{i_{d_+}}$ is replaced by $L_i \ \oplus \ L_{i_{d_+}}$ since spins are represented by boolean entries $L_i$. \\ The XOR bitwise operator $ \oplus $ is applied on the binary couple
$(L_i,L_{i_{d_+}})$ so that it returns the same value of $\sigma_i\sigma_{i_{d_+}}$ which can be $\pm1$. \\
From the $i$ index coordinates $\mathbf{a} = (a_0,a_1,..,a_{D-1})$ the $i_{d_+}$ index coordinates \\
$\mathbf{a^{d_+}} = (a^{d_+}_0,a^{d_+}_1,..,a^{d_+}_{D-1})$ can be computed. \\
The vector $\mathbf{a^{d_+}}$ differs from $\mathbf{a}$ only on the $d$-th entry $a^{d_+}_d$ which is the only one to be increased, this is computed as $(a_d + 1)\%N$ since we are applying periodic boundary conditions on the Lattice. \\
From this formulas we can express the $i_{d_+}$ index as the sum of two terms:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  i_{d_+} &=& \left\{ \sum_{j = 0}^{d-1}a_jN^j  [(a_d + 1)\%N]N^d \right\} + \left\{ \sum_{j = d+1}^{D-1}a_jN^j \right\}  \\
          &=& \left\{(i + N^d)\%N^{d+1} \right\}  +  \left\{ (i/N^{d+1})N^{d+1}  \right\}
\end{eqnarray*}
\textbf{n.b.} if $d=D-1$ the second term is 0, so it's not computed by the algorithm.

\newpage

\subsection{Metropolis Algorithm}

The Metropolis Algorithm proposes a Lattice configuration $q'$ which differs from the initial configuration $q$ only by one spin. \\
The possible $N^D$ configurations are chosen with uniform probability. \\
Defining the ratio $a = p(q')/p(q)$ , $q'$ is accepted if $a \leq 1$, that is, if $q'$ has a greater probability then $q'$ is accepted. \\
Otherwise if $ a \leq 1 $ then $q'$ is accepted with probability $a$. \\ \\
According to equation (3) the ratio $a$ is  $\exp \lbrace -\beta \Delta E \rbrace $ , so it's easy to observe that when $a \leq 1 $ than  $\Delta E \leq 0$. The latter is taken as the condition for accepting the configuration.  \\ \\
The algorithm is implemented according to the following procedure :

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Random integer $i$ is drawn from $\{0,1,...,N^D-1\}$ with uniform probability
	\item Energy variation $\Delta E$ resulting from flipping the $i$-spin of Lattice is computed
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $\Delta E \leq 0$ $i$-spin is flipped;\\
		\item Else $i$-spin is flipped with probability $\exp \lbrace -\beta \Delta E \rbrace $ ; ($k_b 				  =1$)\\
	\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}
This section wants to summarize the simulation results. Under this purpose we underline two main effects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Finite size and finite volume of the lattice imply magnetization and energy fluctuations; periodic conditions reduce this phenomena. Moreover finite size leads to no residual magnetization: this effect is out of the temperature's range studied.

\item Importance sampling algorithms can produce correlated configurations corresponding to different steps of the simulation. This phenomena is in contrast with theoretical hypothesis of microstates independence and can be correctly treated throw binning technique.

\end{itemize}

\subparagraph*{Calibrating the model}


The binning method can take into account the correlation between different configurations. Measures corresponding to different steps of the simulation can have a correct error valuation throw this technique: we divide a set of $N$ ordered configurations in $N/2^n$ groups (each one with $n$ elements), we calculate the mean for each bin and we iterate this process until the desired level of binning; then we calculate the global mean and its error. In this way we correlate the measure at a particular level of binning (higher level $\rightarrow$ correlation length $<<$ size of the bins $\rightarrow$ lower correlation $\rightarrow$ higher error). We chose the eighth level of binning for which we found a plateau in the error-level graph.

\section{Conclusions}
This work has analyzed a new solution for the LMP characterized by the delivery process carried out by citizens. As we shown in the first section, the today city complexity brought a proportional increase of the transportation costs in it; indeed the presented solution, based on the sharing economy, can be ecologically and economically sustainable. Citizen becomes active actors in the transportation process delivering packs all around the city. The Agent-Based Model has been realized with a scaled map in order to express the Turin's distances and adequate (from a computational point of view) parameters:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
    \hline
    Numb. Packs & Numb. Users & Max Delivery Cost & Storage Box Cost & Users' Pay \\
    \hline
    \hline
    1400 & 700 & 1.75 \euro{} & 0.2 \euro{}/two days & 1 \euro{}/km \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
The code has been written in NetLogo 6.0 and, thanks to the Behavior Search tool, brought the following results for parameters we need in order to minimize the expenses:
\begin{center}
  \framebox[12cm]{%
    \begin{minipage}{100mm}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item 10 Storages.
      \item 304 Boxes in each storage.
      \item Total expenses: 1440 \euro{}
      \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}}
\end{center}
Note that the storage's capacity is greater than the minimum required for an uniform distribution of 1400 packs in 10 storages. This shows how the complex system achieves a store optimization for minimizing the expense regarding random place of delivery.
\bigskip

The figure below shows that the curves of expenses and number of packs vs. time have almost an opposite trend; moreover on the right we see that the expenses for each pack decreases with time.

\newpage
Considering an high and a low number of users we saw that the convergence is faster in the first case and, as expected, less expensive. Note that at the end of the day (1600 ticks) in both cases all packs are delivered.


Increasing the fixed cost parameters we saw that expenses grew, but the model still succeed in delivering all packs in a day (1600 ticks) with a cost for each pack that is lower than 1.75\euro{}.
\\
In conclusion this underlines the robustness of the proposed solution both in economical and user's engagement terms, moreover the model held interesting results also in extreme cases.
